config TSPP
	depends on ARCH_MSM
	tristate "TSPP (Transport Stream Packet Processor) Support"
	---help---
	Transport Stream Packet Processor v1 is used to offload the
	processing of MPEG transport streams from the main processor.
	It is used to process incoming transport streams from TSIF
	to supports use-cases such as transport stream live play
	and recording.
	This can also be compiled as a loadable module.

config TSPP2
	depends on ARCH_MPQ8092
	tristate "TSPP2 (Transport Stream Packet Processor v2) Support"
	---help---
	Transport Stream Packet Processor v2 is used to offload the
	processing of MPEG transport streams from the main processor.
	It is used to process incoming transport streams from TSIF or memory
	input, to supports use-cases such as transport stream live play,
	playback from memory and recording.
	This can also be compiled as a loadable module.

config ENSIGMA_UCCP_330
	depends on ARCH_MPQ8092
	tristate "ENSIGMA UCCP330 (Internal broadcast demodulator) Support"
	---help---
	Internal broadcast demodulator is used in translation of RF
	broadcast transmitions into MPEG transport stream digital protocol.
	The driver is a thin communication layer that allows access
	to UCCP330 internal memory in order to support high level protocol.
	This can also be compiled as a loadable module.

config CI_BRIDGE_SPI
	depends on SPI_QUP
	tristate "CI Bridge SPI Driver Support"
	---help---
	This driver provides a simple SPI read/write interface to
	an external CI bridge. It implements a character device
	driver interface which allows making SPI transactions
	using the Linux SPI framework.

	To compile this driver as module, choose M here.

config TSC
	depends on ARCH_MPQ8092
	tristate "TSC (Transport Stream Controller) Support"
	---help---
	Transport Stream Controller is used for two major functionalities:
	Mux: enable the routing of the MPEG transport strems from multiple
	sources to multiple destinations.
	CI: communication with the internal Conditional Access Module (CAM)
	over Common Interface (CI).
	This can also be compiled as a loadable module.

config DEMOD_WRAPPER
	depends on ARCH_MPQ8092
	tristate "Demod Wrapper (Part of broadcast HW block) Support"
	---help---
	The Demod wrapper block contains HW units that
	are responsible for navigating and filtering an analog TV or
	digital TV signal to integrated demodulators.
	The driver supports the operation of those units and provides
	a way to set and configure a desired signal path.
