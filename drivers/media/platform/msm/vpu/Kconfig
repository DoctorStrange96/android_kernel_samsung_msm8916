config MSM_VPU
	tristate "MSM VPU"
	depends on VIDEO_V4L2
	---help---
		This flag enables enables the MSM VPU driver.
		This device allows for advanced video post processing using the
		v4l2 api.
		In its original version (no tunneling features) buffers are
		received from HLOS and sent back to HLOS after VPU hardware
		processing.

config MSM_VPU_IN_VCAP
	bool "MSM VCAP/VPU Tunneling"
	depends on MSM_VPU && MSM_VCAP_V2 && ARCH_MPQ8092
	---help---
		This flag enables VCAP/VPU tunneling feature of VPU driver.
		If enabled, VPU driver interacts with video capture. Input
		buffers (already allocated) are received by VPU driver from
		VCAP driver. VPU driver then maps these 'input tunneling
		buffers' for VPU address space and send them to VPU firmware
		for video streaming.

config MSM_VPU_OUT_MDSS
	bool "MSM VPU/MDSS Tunneling"
	depends on MSM_VPU && FB_MSM_MDSS && ARCH_MPQ8092
	---help---
		This flag enables VPU/MDSS tunneling feature of VPU driver.
		If enabled, VPU driver interacts with display. Output buffers
		(already allocated) are received by VPU driver from user space.
		VPU driver then maps these 'output tunneling buffers' for both
		VPU and MDSS address spaces and send them to VPU firmware
		for video streaming.
