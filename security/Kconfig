config SECURITY_DMESG_RESTRICT
	bool "Restrict unprivileged access to the kernel syslog"
	default n
	help
	  This enforces restrictions on unprivileged users reading the kernel
	  syslog via dmesg(8).

	  If this option is not selected, no restrictions will be enforced
	  unless the dmesg_restrict sysctl is explicitly set to (1).

	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config SECURITY_PERF_EVENTS_RESTRICT
	bool "Restrict unprivileged use of performance events"
	depends on PERF_EVENTS
	help
	  If you say Y here, the kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl
	  will be set to 3 by default, and no unprivileged use of the
	  perf_event_open syscall will be permitted unless it is
	  changed.

config SECURITY
	bool "Enable different security models"
	depends on SYSFS
	default y
	help
	  This allows you to choose different security modules to be
	  configured into your kernel.

	  If this option is not selected, the default Linux security
	  model will be used.

	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config SECURITYFS
	bool "Enable the securityfs filesystem"
	help
	  This will build the securityfs filesystem.  It is currently used by
	  the TPM bios character driver and IMA, an integrity provider.  It is
	  not used by SELinux or SMACK.

	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config SECURITY_NETWORK
	bool "Socket and Networking Security Hooks"
	depends on SECURITY
	help
	  This enables the socket and networking security hooks.
	  If enabled, a security module can use these hooks to
	  implement socket and networking access controls.
	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config SECURITY_NETWORK_XFRM
	bool "XFRM (IPSec) Networking Security Hooks"
	depends on XFRM && SECURITY_NETWORK
	help
	  This enables the XFRM (IPSec) networking security hooks.
	  If enabled, a security module can use these hooks to
	  implement per-packet access controls based on labels
	  derived from IPSec policy.  Non-IPSec communications are
	  designated as unlabelled, and only sockets authorized
	  to communicate unlabelled data can send without using
	  IPSec.
	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config SECURITY_PATH
	bool "Security hooks for pathname based access control"
	depends on SECURITY
	help
	  This enables the security hooks for pathname based access control.
	  If enabled, a security module can use these hooks to
	  implement pathname based access controls.
	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config SECURITY_PFT
	bool "Security hooks for Per File Encryption"
	depends on SECURITY
	depends on PFT
	help
	  This enables the security hooks for Per File Encryption.
	  If enabled, a security module can use these hooks to
	  implement file based access controls and encryption.
	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config SECURITY_SECURELEVEL
        bool "Securelevel kernel restriction interface"
	depends on SECURITY
	help
	  This enables support for adding a set of additional kernel security
	  restrictions at runtime. See Documentation/security/securelevel.txt
	  for further information.

config INTEL_TXT
	bool "Enable Intel(R) Trusted Execution Technology (Intel(R) TXT)"
	depends on HAVE_INTEL_TXT
	help
	  This option enables support for booting the kernel with the
	  Trusted Boot (tboot) module. This will utilize
	  Intel(R) Trusted Execution Technology to perform a measured launch
	  of the kernel. If the system does not support Intel(R) TXT, this
	  will have no effect.

	  Intel TXT will provide higher assurance of system configuration and
	  initial state as well as data reset protection.  This is used to
	  create a robust initial kernel measurement and verification, which
	  helps to ensure that kernel security mechanisms are functioning
	  correctly. This level of protection requires a root of trust outside
	  of the kernel itself.

	  Intel TXT also helps solve real end user concerns about having
	  confidence that their hardware is running the VMM or kernel that
	  it was configured with, especially since they may be responsible for
	  providing such assurances to VMs and services running on it.

	  See <http://www.intel.com/technology/security/> for more information
	  about Intel(R) TXT.
	  See <http://tboot.sourceforge.net> for more information about tboot.
	  See Documentation/intel_txt.txt for a description of how to enable
	  Intel TXT support in a kernel boot.

	  If you are unsure as to whether this is required, answer N.

config LSM_MMAP_MIN_ADDR
	int "Low address space for LSM to protect from user allocation"
	depends on SECURITY && SECURITY_SELINUX
	default 32768 if ARM
	default 65536
	help
	  This is the portion of low virtual memory which should be protected
	  from userspace allocation.  Keeping a user from writing to low pages
	  can help reduce the impact of kernel NULL pointer bugs.

	  For most ia64, ppc64 and x86 users with lots of address space
	  a value of 65536 is reasonable and should cause no problems.
	  On arm and other archs it should not be higher than 32768.
	  Programs which use vm86 functionality or have some need to map
	  this low address space will need the permission specific to the
	  systems running LSM.

config SECURITY_TPE
	bool "Trusted Path Execution (TPE)"
	default n
	help
	  If you say Y here, you will be able to choose a gid to add to the
	  supplementary groups of users you want to mark as "untrusted."
	  These users will not be able to execute any files that are not in
	  root-owned directories writable only by root.  If the sysctl option
	  is enabled, a sysctl option with name "tpe" is created.

config SECURITY_TPE_ALL
	bool "Partially restrict all non-root users"
	depends on SECURITY_TPE
	help
	  If you say Y here, all non-root users will be covered under
	  a weaker TPE restriction.  This is separate from, and in addition to,
	  the main TPE options that you have selected elsewhere.  Thus, if a
	  "trusted" GID is chosen, this restriction applies to even that GID.
	  Under this restriction, all non-root users will only be allowed to
	  execute files in directories they own that are not group or
	  world-writable, or in directories owned by root and writable only by
	  root.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name
	  "tpe_restrict_all" is created.

config SECURITY_TPE_INVERT
	bool "Invert GID option"
	depends on SECURITY_TPE
	help
	  If you say Y here, the group you specify in the TPE configuration will
	  decide what group TPE restrictions will be *disabled* for.  This
	  option is useful if you want TPE restrictions to be applied to most
	  users on the system.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option
	  with name "tpe_invert" is created.  Unlike other sysctl options, this
	  entry will default to on for backward-compatibility.

config SECURITY_TPE_GID
	int
	default SECURITY_TPE_UNTRUSTED_GID if (SECURITY_TPE && !SECURITY_TPE_INVERT)
	default SECURITY_TPE_TRUSTED_GID if (SECURITY_TPE && SECURITY_TPE_INVERT)

config SECURITY_TPE_UNTRUSTED_GID
	int "GID for TPE-untrusted users"
	depends on SECURITY_TPE && !SECURITY_TPE_INVERT
	default 1005
	help
	  Setting this GID determines what group TPE restrictions will be
	  *enabled* for.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option
	  with name "tpe_gid" is created.

config SECURITY_TPE_TRUSTED_GID
	int "GID for TPE-trusted users"
	depends on SECURITY_TPE && SECURITY_TPE_INVERT
	default 1005
	help
	  Setting this GID determines what group TPE restrictions will be
	  *disabled* for.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option
	  with name "tpe_gid" is created.
